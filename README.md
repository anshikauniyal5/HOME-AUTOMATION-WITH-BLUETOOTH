#This circuit is a home automation setup built around an ESP32 microcontroller, which controls four relays connected to LEDs of different colors—green, yellow, blue, and white—each representing a separate device or appliance. The ESP32 is wired to a breadboard, where it interfaces with the relays and input switches. The switches are configured with internal pull-up resistors, and the ESP32 reads their states to toggle the relays accordingly. A debounce delay of 300 milliseconds is implemented in the code to prevent false triggering from switch noise. This design allows for manual control of multiple devices via physical switches, while showcasing how microcontroller logic can be used to manage relay-based automation in a smart home environment. It is designed in wokwi simulator.
